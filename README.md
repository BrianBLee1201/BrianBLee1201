Hello, my name is Brian Lee. I graduated from University of Southern California in May 2025 with two bachelor degrees and I am completely open to any computer science-related field roles (AI/Machine learning, software engineering, etc). 

I am currently a part-time teacher in K-12 education in Westminster, CA.
